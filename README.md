# Titration-Calculator
This is a work-related project that calculates titrant volumes for buffer solutions. 

One of the main tasks for a buffer prep in a biochem laboratory is that of titration. This almost always involves a time consuming process of carefully adding drops of an acid or base, i.e. the titrant. 
As a current buffer technician, I thought that it would be a great time advantage if a program could calculate the necessary titrant volume needed for every buffer we have on file. 

Given the complex nature of compound interactions and hydrogen ion concentrations involving several compounds, the goal of this program is to simplify both the process and the science. 
Thus, with this program being a prototype, it makes a few assumptions about the buffer making process. 
  1. Given that the list of our most popular buffers is quite small, I have reduced the number of buffers that this program can process. 
  2. The basis of the program's calculations lie in the Henderson Hasselbalch equation, utilizing the pKa of the only buffering ingredient found in each of our most-made buffers: HEPES (pKa = 7.55). 
 
 Future versions of this program (currently underway) include a more robust bank of buffers and will utilize predictive modeling of hydrogen ion calculations, and not simply just HEPES. 
 
 Cheers!
